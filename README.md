# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this challenge, my task is to conduct a climate analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii to prepare for an upcoming trip. The task is divided into 2 parts. 

Part 1: Analyse and Explore the Climate Data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this section, Python and SQLAlchemy is used to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database, sepcifically with SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

Analsyis is divided into:
1. Precipitation Analysis 
2. Station Analsyis

This code is saved in <climate.ipynb>

Part 2: Design Your Climate App
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next, a FLask API is designed based on the queries that you just developed. Available routes include:

1. Route to welcome page
2. Route to retrieve precipitation data
3. Route to retrieve list of stations 
4. Route to retrieve temperature observations for the previous year
5. Route to retrieve temperature statistics for a given start date
6. Route to retrieve temperature statistics for a given date range

This code is saved in <app.py>

The data required for this is stored in the Resources folder.
